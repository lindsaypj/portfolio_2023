# Portfolio
This is my latest portfolio. The design incorporates a terminal that is used to navigate and interact with the site.

## Terminal Commands

### /paths
Paths are like navigation, and will change the rendered content of page.
 - /about_me
 - /portfolio
 - /terminal

### .methods()
Methods allow you to interact with the page. This means they are path specific.
 - .play()

### commands
Commands are like methods, but they are global.
 - theme [dark|light]
